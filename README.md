# VAE-based-Medical-Image-Generator

Idea: Generate images from different imaging modalities by training on MedMNIST dataset
> Basic Task (0.3):
* Implement and train VAE to generate medical images from MedMNIST dataset

>Extension (0.7):
* Implement VAE variant for (a) disentanglement or (b) conditional training and evaluate for >= 3 different modalities (e.g. X-ray, Pathology, Dermatology)
